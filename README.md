Blois_et_al_ecography_cooc
==========================

This repository holds some R code I wrote to apply Blois *et al* [2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.00779/abstract) Ecography paper's framework on plant co-occurrences patterns in Winsonsin. In this project, I am looking at patterns and dynamics of understory plant co-occurrent patterns in three vegetation types in 1950s and 2000s. As a result, all functions were written for my particular project and not for general use. But I think it should be very easy to modify the code to fit your own needs.
