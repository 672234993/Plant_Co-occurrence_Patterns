Plant_Co-ocurrence_Patterns
==========================

This repository holds some R code and the manuscript I wrote to study patterns and dynamics of understory plant co-occurrent patterns in three vegetation types in 1950s and 2000s. All functions were written for my particular project and not for general use. But I think it should be very easy to modify the code to fit your own needs.
